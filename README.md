# Overview
This repository contains a Fraud Detection Case Study for Galvanize Data Science Immersive (proprietary information excluded). The end result of this case study was a web app that streams EventBrite events and predicts fraudulent event postings (See app.py the app folder). The data used for this repository is proprietary and therefore, this code cannot be run from a computer without access to the original data; however, the trained model can be extracted from model.pkl. More explanation regarding this project can be found in "Fraud Detection Case Study.pdf"
