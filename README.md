# FraudDetection
Fraud Detection Case Study for Galvanize Data Science Immersive (proprietary information excluded)

# What is this?
This is a a web app that streams EventBrite events and detects fraudulent events. Unfortunately, you won't be able to see the raw data that we used to train our model, but you can access the model from the model.pkl file.

# Results 
If you are interested in seeing the results we achieved check out <b>Fraud Detection Case Study.pdf.</b> This also includes plenty of visualizations.

# What was the process
In one day we cleaned up a fairly messy data set, removing colinearity and overly-sparse columns. We then built a Gradient Boosted Tree and Random Forest Model. The higher performing of these models was the Random Forest. With this model, we achieved 98.8% accuracy and 91.1% recall.
